    <introduction>
      <p>
        Your local <c>main</c> branch is now in synch with the upstream <c>main</c> branch.
        What’s left is to also synch the <c>main</c> branch in your origin repo.

          Type in the command you wrote in <xref ref="ex-synching-main-to-origin-a"/> and examine the output given.
          It should not contain any error messages.
          If it does, look at the format of the command from <xref ref="ex-synching-main-to-origin-a"/> and try again.
        </p>
      </statement>

      <statement>
        <p>
          Examine the output from <xref ref="ex-synching-main-to-origin-a"/>.
          You should see a lot of information about deltas and objects.
          Those are terms related to the inner workings of git that we will not worry about.
          If you don’t see this information about deltas and objects but see an error message instead, revisit <xref ref="ex-synching-main-to-origin-a"/> and try again.
        </p>

        <p>
          The last two lines of the output in part a should contain some recognizable information.
          What do you think that these lines are telling you?

          Only look at the last two lines, the one that starts with "To" and the one that starts with a SHA code.

    <conclusion>
      <p>
        As with most things related to Git and GitHub, there are a number of different ways to synchronize.
        For example, you can also fetch the changes from the upstream main to your origin and then pull them from there to your local repository.
