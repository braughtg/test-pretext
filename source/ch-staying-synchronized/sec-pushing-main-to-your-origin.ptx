    <introduction>
      <p>
        Your local main branch is now in synch with the upstream main branch.
        What’s left is to also synch the main branch in your origin repo.
      </p>

      <statement>
        <p>
          Recall that you previously used the
        </p>

        <p>
          <c> git push &lt;remote repo name&gt; &lt;branch&gt; </c>
        </p>

        <p>
          command to push your feature branch from your local repo to your origin repo.
          Use the <c>git push</c> command to push the <c>main</c> branch of your local repo to your remote <c>origin</c> repo.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </task>


    <task xml:id="ex-synching-main-to-origin-b" label="ex-synching-main-to-origin-b">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Examine the output from <xref ref="ex-synching-main-to-origin-a"/>.
          You should see a lot of information about deltas and objects.
          Those are terms related to the inner workings of git that we will not worry about.
          If you don’t see this information about deltas and objects but see an error message instead, revisit <xref ref="ex-synching-main-to-origin-a"/> and try again.
        </p>

        <p>
          The last two lines of the output in part a should contain some recognizable information.
          What do you think that these lines are telling you?

      <hint>
        <p>
          Only look at the last two lines, the one that starts with "To" and the one that starts with a SHA code.

  <conclusion>
    <p>
      As with most things related to Git and GitHub, there are a number of different ways to synchronize.
      For example, you can also fetch the changes from the upstream main to your origin and then pull them from there to your local repository.
