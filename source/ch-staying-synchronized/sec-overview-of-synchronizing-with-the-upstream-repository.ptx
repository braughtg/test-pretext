  <title>Overview of Synchronizing with the Upstream Repository</title>

  <introduction>
  <p>
    As changes from pull requests (yours and others) are merged into upstream <c>main</c>, the <c>main</c> branches in your local and origin repos will get <em>out of synch with the upstream</em>.
  </p>
  </introduction>

  <p>
    Now, recall that upstream <c>main</c> should be the starting point for all new work.
    So, before you can work on something new, you’ll want to make your <c>main</c> branches look like the upstream <c>main</c> (i.e.
    you will synchronize them with the upstream).
    This is a two-step process.
    You will pull the upstream <c>main</c> into your local repository and then you will push it to your origin.
    <xref ref="fig-synching-with-upstream" /> shows how pulling <c>main</c> from the upstream and then pushing it to your origin synchs the <c>main</c> branches.
