  <title>Let's Do it Again</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
      You’ve learned a lot about Git and GitHub.
      But, to become proficient with these tools takes a lot of repetition and practice.
      This section asks you to go through the process of finding an issue, fixing it and creating a pull request again.
      This is good practice but what you will be asked to do has also been carefully planned to set us up for the next chapter too!

            Clearly there are not enough “Round2” issues for everyone to have their own as was the case with the “Round1” issues.
            So, this time there will be multiple people working on the same issue.

          <p>
            Pick one of the “Round2” issues to work on and make a comment on it to indicate your interest in working on it.
            Note it is not necessary that the issue be assigned to you this time.
            Try to spread out across the issues so that multiple people have commented that they are working on each one.
            Give the Issue # and title that you chose.
