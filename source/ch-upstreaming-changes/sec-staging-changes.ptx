  <title>Staging Changes</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
      As you saw in the previous section, you now have modifications to your local files that have not been staged.
      The process of staging changes (i.e.
      adding the files to the stage) is illustrated in <xref ref="fig-staging-changes" />.
      Recall from <xref ref="fig-edit-local-files-on-feature-branch" /> that the blue dot in <em>Local Files</em> represents the changes you made.
      In <xref ref="fig-staging-changes" />, those changes are staged and will be made into a commit that is added to your feature branch in the next section.

      The exercises in this section will walk you through staging the changes you made to your <em>Local Files</em>.

      <p>
        The <c>git stage &lt;file&gt;</c> command adds the indicated file to the stage, preparing it to become a part of the next commit.
        Use the <c>git stage &lt;file&gt;</c> command now to stage the file that you edited.

    <task xml:id="ex-staging-changes-a" label="ex-staging-changes-a">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Provide the command you entered.

        <p>
          Note that git also has a <c>git add</c> command that is equivalent to <c>git stage</c>.
          So, you can add files to the stage using either <c>git stage</c> or <c>git add</c>.
          These activities will use <c>git stage</c> because it seems more descriptive of what is happening.
          However, you are likely to see <c>git add</c> used in other resources, so it is worth knowing that they are equivalent.
          Provide the <c>git add</c> command that would be equivalent to your answer in <xref ref="ex-staging-changes-a" />.

          Now run the <c>git status</c> command again.
          Compare your output in <xref ref="ex-staging-changes-a" /> to the output in <xref ref="ex-verify-changes-a" />.
