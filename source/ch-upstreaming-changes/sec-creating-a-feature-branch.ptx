  <title>Creating a Feature Branch</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
      When you set out to make changes to the project you will do so by working on a feature branch.
      The exercises in this section will walk you through the process of creating a feature branch on which you will fix the issue that you claimed in <xref ref="topic-the-issue-tracker" />.

      <p>
        The <c>git status</c> command provides the current status of your local repository.

          What part of the output tells you which branch is currently active in your repository?

    <introduction>
      <p>
        The <c>git branch &lt;name&gt;</c> command creates a new branch with the given <em>name</em>.
        When creating a branch, you should give it a short but descriptive name (e.g.
        <em>FixTypoInReadme</em>).
        Note: <em>name</em> may not have spaces, so you can use - (dashes) or CammelCaseText to divide words in your branch names.

            Create a new feature branch with a descriptive name that you will use to fix the issue that you claimed.

          Creating a new branch with the <c>git branch</c> command makes your new branch the active branch.

          <c>git branch &lt;name&gt;</c> only creates the branch.

          After you create a branch what needs to be done to make it active?
