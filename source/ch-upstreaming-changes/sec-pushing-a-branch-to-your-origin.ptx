  <title>Pushing a Branch to Your Origin</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
      You have made the changes necessary to address the issue you were assigned, and you are now ready to upstream those changes.
      In order to do that, the first step is to get the changes you have made into GitHub so that the upstream maintainers can be told about them.
    </p>
  </introduction>

  <exercises>
  <title />
  <p>
    As shown in <xref ref="fig-pushing-feature-branch" />, this is done by <em>pushing your feature branch</em> to your origin repository.
    More generally, pushing a branch, copies it from a local repository to a remote repository.

    <term>Getting a Personal Access Token: </term>
  </p>

  <p component="linux-kit-client">
    Before you will be able to push your feature branch to GitHub you will have to get a <term>Personal Access Token (PAT)</term> from GitHub.
    A PAT is like a password but has some security benefits.
    In particular, you can have multiple different PATs.
    Each one can have different limits on what can be done with it and each one can be revoked individually without affecting the others.
  </p>

  <p component="linux-kit-client">
    When interacting with GitHub using the git CLI (e.g.
    when pushing a branch), GitHub requires that you use a PAT for authentication instead of your password.
  </p>

  <exercise xml:id="ex-getting-pat" label="ex-getting-pat" component="linux-kit-client">
    <introduction>
      <p>
        Follow GitHub's instructions for creating a (classic) personal access token: <url href="https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token#creating-a-personal-access-token-classic" visual="docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token#creating-a-personal-access-token-classic">Creating a Personal Access Token (classic)</url>.
      </p>

      <p>
        When doing so be sure to:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              Choose “repo” for the “scopes and permissions.”
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              Be sure to copy and paste your PAT somewhere safe – maybe e-mail it to yourself.
              You will not be able to retrieve it again after you leave the page.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <p>
        Note: Typing or even copy and pasting your PAT every time it is needed can be a hassle.
        To help, the git CLI provides what is known as the <term>credential helper</term>.
        The git CLI in the KitClient has configured the credential helper so that your PAT will be stored when you enter it the first time.
        It will then be used automatically for future commands.
        If you are curious, you can learn more about the credential helper here: <url href="https://techexpertise.medium.com/storing-git-credentials-with-git-credential-helper-33d22a6b5ce7" visual="techexpertise.medium.com/storing-git-credentials-with-git-credential-helper-33d22a6b5ce7">Storing Git Credentials with Git Credential Helper</url>.

        The <c>git push &lt;remote repository name&gt; &lt;branch&gt;</c> command will push the specified branch of your local repository to the specified remote repository (i.e.

        Use a command that will push your <em>feature branch</em> from your local repository to your <em>origin repository</em> on GitHub.

      <p>
        Note: You can use the name of the remote repository, so you do not need to use the full URL.
        You will also need to paste your PAT as the password when it is requested. <em>The cursor will not move when you put in the PAT nor will you see any characters. After you type or paste it hit Enter</em>

      <p>
        When you attempted to push in <xref ref="ex-push-branch-vscode"/>, you should have gotten an authorization error.
        When this happens VSCode will prompt you in the lower right to open GitPod and configure the authorization.
        Do that.
        When done, return to your GitPod workspace and try the push again.
        It should work.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you get the same pop up, open it again.
        Look for the GitHub authorization.
        Click the "..." menu next to it and edit it.
        Ensure that "repo" with read/write permissions are set and save it.
        It will send you to GitHub to complete the authorization.
        When done, return to your GitPod workspace and try the push again.
