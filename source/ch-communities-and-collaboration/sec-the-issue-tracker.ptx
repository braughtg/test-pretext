  <title>The Issue Tracker</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
      FOSS projects often use an issue tracker to maintain a list of bugs to be fixed, features to be added and other tasks to be completed.
      Thus, the issue tracker is a good place to go in order to find something to work on in a FOSS project.
      The exercises in this section will guide you through interaction with the GitKit FarmData2 issue tracker as shown in <xref ref="fig-issue-tracker"/>.
      By the end of the section you will have found an issue to work on.
    </p>

  <subsection>
    <title>Claiming an Issue</title>

    <introduction>
      <p>
        Because projects often have many people working asynchronously many will have a process by which contributors can <term>claim</term> an issue that they are interested in working on and have that issue <term>assigned</term> to them in the issue tracker.
      </p>

      <p>
        The following exercises will guide you through the process of claiming an issue to work on in the GitKit FarmData2 issue tracker.
      </p>
    </introduction>

    <exercises>
    <title />
    <exercise xml:id="ex-identifying-assigned-issues" label="ex-identifying-assigned-issues" >
      <statement>
        <p>
          Examine the GitKit FarmData2 issue tracker.
          How can you tell which issue have already been assigned?
        </p>
      </statement>


      <choices randomize="yes">
        <choice correct="yes">
          <statement>
            The avatar of the assigned user appears to the right of the issue title.

        </choice>

        <choice correct="no">
          <statement>
            The issue no longer appears in the issue tracker.
          </statement>
        </choice>

        <choice correct="no">
          <statement>
            The username of assigned user appears next to the issue title.
          </statement>
        </choice>

        <choice correct="no">
          <statement>
            The issue is moved to a separate list of assigned issues.
          </statement>
        </choice>

        <choice correct="no">
          <statement>
            The issue tracker does not show any indication that an issue has been assigned.
          </statement>
        </choice>
      </choices>

      <hint>
        <p>
          Look for some lines for issues that look different than the others and hover your mouse over the different parts.
        </p>
      </hint>
    </exercise>

    <p>
      In the GitKit FarmData2 issue tracker, contributors interested in working on an issue can request that it be assigned to them by commenting on the issue with the exact message:
    </p>

    <p xml:id="topic-issue-claim-message">
      <c>I would like to work on this please!</c>
    </p>

    <p>
      The first person who comments on an unclaimed issue with this message will receive a response from the project maintainers.
      This messages will indicate that the issue has been assigned to them and the issue tracker will update to show this as you saw in <xref ref="ex-identifying-assigned-issues" />.
    </p>

    <exercise xml:id="ex-claim-an-issue" label="ex-claim-an-issue">
      <statement>

          Use the GitKit FarmData2 issue tracker to complete the following tasks.

        </statement>

        <hint>

          </p>
          <p>
            Remember you must type <xref ref="topic-issue-claim-message" text="custom">the message</xref> exactly as shown.

        </statement>

        <hint>
          <p>
            If you did not receive a response, wait a few minutes and reload the issue tracker page again.
            Sometimes it takes a few minutes for your comment to be noticed and the issue to be assigned.
            If you still do not receive a response check that you typed <xref ref="topic-issue-claim-message" text="custom">the message</xref> correctly.
          </p>

          <p>
            If you received a response telling you that you were not assigned the issue, someone else slipped a comment in just ahead of you and was assigned the issue.
            If this happens, just try <xref ref="ex-claim-an-issue-b" /> again.
