  <title>Communities and Collaboration</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
      The exercises in this chapter focus on FOSS communities.  They explore what they are, how they are organized, the principles on which they operate and the roles that the community members take on.  They also begin to look at some of the tools and processes that these communities use to support those principles and coordinate their work. You will see how git and GitHub work together to allow FOSS communities to share their work and to collaborate.  In particular, you will create a fork and clone, and see how they make it possible for a diverse and distributed group of contributors to work asynchronously and to contribute useful changes back to the upstream.  
    </p>

    <p>
      In this and the next several chapters you will use a copy of the FarmData2 project repository to gain hands-on experience using use git and GitHub.  This experience will strengthen your understanding of git, GitHub and FOSS communities.
