  <title>Your Development Environment</title>

  <introduction
    xml:id="topic-dev-env-intro">
    <p>
      You now have been assigned an <term>issue</term> to work on and yuu have created a <term>fork</term> of the <term>upstream</term> GitKit FarmData2 repository into your GitHub space.
    </p>
    <p>
      To work on your issue you will need to setup your <term>development environment</term>.  Your development environment is where you will create your <term>clone</term> of the repository, where you will edit files, and where you will use `git` commands to add your changes to to your clone and <term>push</term> those changes to your <term>origin</term>.  
    </p>
    <p>
      Many FOSS contributors will setup the development environment on their personal machines. Because student machines vary greatly the GitKit provides a browser based development environment, called a <term>KitClient</term>. This development environment runs in the cloud and you will access it using your web browser.  This development environment includes standard development tools but also has a few features designed specifically to help you stay on track when completing the GitKit's hands-on exercises.

    <title>Configuring the Git Client</title>
    <introduction>
      <p>
        Your development environment includes a <term>Git client</term>. The Git client is the tool that you will use to interact with Git repositories, such as the GitKit FarmData2 repository.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are lots of different Git clients. Some are graphical and some use a text interface. These exercises, introduce you to Git using its text-based <term>command line interface (CLI)</term>.  This is the most general way to interact with Git and will provide a conceptual foundation for using any other Git client that you might encounter.

        <introduction>
          <p>
            Recall from class that Git repositories maintain a complete history of all changes, including who made each change.  To do this, Git needs to know a little bit of information about you.
          </p>
          <p>
            Git identifies the author of each change using two pieces of information: A name and an e-mail. For name, you might decide to your full name, or a nickname, or your GitHub username.  Just keep in mind that whatever name you use will be associated with all of the changes you make. For e-mail, you can again use any valid e-mail associated with you. 
          </p>

              Set your “Timeout” to 10 minutes. This will stop your development environment if you are away from it for more than 5 minutes.  This will help to ensure that your free GitPod credits are not accidentally used up if you forget to stop your development environment.

              If your development environment times out and stops you can restart it using the steps in <xref ref="topic-restarting-dev-env" />.
