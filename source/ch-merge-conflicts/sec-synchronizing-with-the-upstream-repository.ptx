  <title>Synchronizing with the Upstream Repository</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
      From the previous section you know that there is a merge conflict between the upstream <c>main</c> branch and your feature branch.  Before you can resolve this conflict you will need to get the changes from the upstream <c>main</c> branch into your local and origin <c>main</c> branches.
    </p>
    <p>
      The process you learned for synchronizing with the upstream in <xref ref="topic-staying-synchronized" /> (<xref ref="topic-pulling-the-upstream-main-branch" /> and <xref ref="topic-pushing-main-to-your-origin" />) will copy the changes in the upstream <c>main</c> branch into your local and origin <c>main</c> branches. This process is illustrated in <xref ref="fig-synching-upstream-changes-with-conflict" />. 
    </p>

      The exercises in the remainder of this section will help you to synchronize your local and origin <c>main</c> branches with the upstream <c>main</c> branch.

          To do the synchronization you'll need to have your development environment running.

        <p>
          Please be patient as this can take a few minutes.  When the development environment is ready you will see the message "Kit development environment is ready for use." and your browser window will look similar to the following:

                Uh Oh. It doesn't look like your synchronization worked.  Try running the commands from <xref ref="ex-synch-main-local-upstream-cmds" /> again.
