  <title>Confirming the Merge Conflict</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
      While you were working on your Round2 issue your instructor, playing the role of a maintainer, merged some changes into the upstream <c>main</c>. These changes were merged after you created the feature branch for your Round2 issue. This situation is illustrated in <xref ref="fig-conflicting-upstream-changes" />.
    </p>

    <p>
      <figure xml:id="fig-conflicting-upstream-changes" >
        <caption> Conflicting Upstream Changes. </caption>
        <image source="images/ch-merge-conflicts/conflicting-upstream-changes.png" width="75%">
          <description>
            Changes were merged into the upstream <c>main</c> branch that could conflict with changes in the pull request feature branches.
          </description>
        </image>
      </figure>
    </p>

    <p>
      The changes that your instructor merged were specifically designed to create a conflict with the change that you made when you fixed your Round2 issue. Thus, the pull request you made in <xref ref="topic-lets-do-it-again" /> now contains a conflicting change and therefore cannot be merged automatically.
    </p>

    <p>
      The activities in the remainder of this section will reinforce your understanding of how the conflict arose, confirm that your <c>main</c> branch is out of synch with the upstream, and that your pull request cannot be merged automatically.
